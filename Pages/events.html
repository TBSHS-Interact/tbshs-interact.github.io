<h3>International Women's Day</h3>
<p>This day is very important at TBSHS. Although we are a single-sex male school from years 7-11, our Sixth Form is
    mixed education, and is the heart of the school. IWD was on <a>Sunday, 8 March 2020</a>, and despite not being in
    school on this day, we recognised it, within school, for a whole week afterwards.

<h3>Wear It Red for World Cancer Day</h3>
<p>We marked World Cancer Day on <a>Tuesday, 4 February 2020</a> by wearing one item of red with our school uniforms. On
    days like this, the school comes together to great things. This year we raised £900 for cancer charities.

<h3>Holocaust Memorial Day</h3>
<p>Once again at TBSHS we marked <a>Monday, 27 January 2020</a> as a day to remember the horrific persecution faced by
    people
    during the Holocaust. This year, Holocause survivor Hannah Lewis came to the school to speak to the Sixth Form about
    her memories during this time.</p>

<h3>Martin Luther King Day</h3>
<p><a>Monday, 20 January 2020</a> was a day to remember how Martin Luther King fought, peacfully, for his rights. Martin
    Luther King is well known for his civil rights campaign in America in the 1960s. He is perhaps best known for his "I
    have a dream" speech.</p>

<h3>Wear It Blue for Mental Health</h3>
<p>This themed non-uniform day in October, was an opportunity for poeple to wear one item of blue clothing with
    their school uniform. Money raised went towards raising awareness for the mental health charity Mind. This is an
    issue which needs to be talked about. We all have mental health, we should all feel comfortable talking about
    it.
