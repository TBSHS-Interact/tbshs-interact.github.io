    <h1>Helping The Enviroment</h1>
    <p>This year Interact is trying to play a bigger part in making TBSHS an eco-friendly enviroment. In today's
        world, the environment is in serious danger, and it's mankind's fault. </p>

    <h1>What can we do around the school to help the enviroment?</h1>
    <img src="Images/logo_eco.png" style="float: left; height: 220px; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>It's the small things that can make a big difference:
        <br>
        • Turn off the lights when you leave the room.
        <br>
        • Recycle all paper.
        <br>
        • Use reusable water bottles.
        <br>
        • Put rubbish in the bins around school.
        <br>
        • Turn off taps when you are done with them.
        <br>
        • Use hand-dryers instead of paper towels.
        <br>
        • If possible, walk to/from school, or share a lift with someone else.
    </p>

    <h1>Why should we try to help the enviroment?</h1>
    <p>
        The Earth is undergoing climate change at a rate never before seen, and this is due to the actions of humans.
        Our
        burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity and to drive our cars produces large amounts of harmful,
        greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
        <br>
        Humans caused this problem, it's therefore our responsibility to fix it.
