    <h2>Who are we?</h2>

    <p>Interact is a global organisation, founded by the <a href="https://www.rotary.org/">Rotary Club</a>, with the aim
        of raising money and awareness for various charities. We aim to do our best to help our community, and the
        planet as
        a whole, in any way we can.
        <br>
        There are over 20 000 Interact clubs accross the globe, operating in 159 different countries, with over 450 000
        members.
        <br>
        Interact has been running at <a href="http://www.tbshs.org/">TBSHS</a> for many years now, and since we
        started, we have raised many thousands of pounds, each year, for a wide variety of charities and good causes.
    </p>

    <h2>How do we raise money?</h2>

    <p>We raise money within the school in a variety of ways. These range from non-uniform days, to our annual talent
        show - SHOWCASE.
        <br>
        We are particularly proud of our efforts in raising money for national campaigns, including, but not limited to,
        The Poppy Appeal, Comic/Sports Relief and Children in Need.
    </p>

    <h2>How can you get involved?</h2>

    <p>If you want to play a part in helping other people, and you are a student at The Bishop's Stortford High School,
        come along to Room 8 every Wednesday lunch time to join our meetings.
        <br>
        We will discuss new ideas for how we can continue to help our community both within, and outside of the school.
        <br><br>
        If you are not a student at TBSHS, you can still get involved with Rotary and Interact.
        <br>
        Find out if your own school has an Interact club, if it doesn't, create one.
